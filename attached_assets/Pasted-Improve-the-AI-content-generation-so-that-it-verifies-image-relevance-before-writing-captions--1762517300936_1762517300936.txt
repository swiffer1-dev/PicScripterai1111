Improve the AI content generation so that it verifies image relevance before writing captions.

**Goal:** Prevent the AI from writing mismatched content (e.g., real estate description for a cat photo). Detect image category first, and if it doesn’t match the user’s selected topic, show a friendly warning instead of generating a caption.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Image Category Detection**

   * Use a lightweight image classification model (e.g., `@tensorflow-models/mobilenet` or `clip` via `replicate` or `OpenAI embeddings`).
   * Extract top predicted labels from the image (e.g., “cat”, “house”, “food”, “car”).
   * Compare the detected labels to the user’s selected or inferred post category (e.g., Real Estate, Pets, Fashion, Food).

2. **Mismatch Handling**

   * If the detected category **does not align** with the selected content type:

     * Don’t call the caption-generation endpoint.
     * Instead, show a friendly message to the user:

       > “Hmm… this image looks like a **cat**, but you selected **Real Estate**. Please upload an image that matches your category so we can create the best caption!”

3. **UI Feedback**

   * Display the warning above the caption editor in a clear card or toast.
   * Offer a “Try Again” button to upload a new image or change the category.

4. **Backend Safeguard**

   * Add a check in the AI generation API route (`/api/generate-caption` or equivalent):

     * Run the image classification first.
     * Only proceed with `generateCaption()` if the category confidence matches (e.g., ≥ 0.6 cosine similarity to the target topic).

5. **Optional Enhancements**

   * Cache recent classification results to avoid re-analyzing the same image.
   * Log mismatches in the analytics DB for later quality improvements.

✅ **Success Criteria**

* When the user uploads a mismatched image, AI stops and displays a category warning.
* When the image matches, captions are generated normally.
* Prevents obviously wrong captions like “House for sale” for animals or products.
