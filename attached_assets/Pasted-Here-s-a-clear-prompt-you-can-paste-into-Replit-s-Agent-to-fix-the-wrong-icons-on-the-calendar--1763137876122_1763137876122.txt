Here’s a clear prompt you can paste into Replit’s Agent to fix the wrong icons on the calendar:

**Prompt for Replit Agent**

I have a bug on my **Calendar** page:
Posts that come from **X (Twitter)** are being rendered with the **Instagram icon**. I need you to fix the platform icon logic so each scheduled post shows the **correct platform logo**.

### What’s happening now

* The posts visible on `/calendar` for **Nov 13** (and others) are X posts (published from my app to X).
* On the calendar, they are shown with the **Instagram logo** instead of the X logo.
* This means the component that renders the event tiles is either:

  * hard-coding the Instagram icon, or
  * using the wrong field to choose the platform, or
  * mapping the platform string incorrectly (e.g., treating `"x"`/`"twitter"` as `"instagram"`).

### What I want you to do

1. **Find the calendar event component**

   * Locate the React component that renders the individual day cells and the posts inside them on `/calendar`.
   * This is likely in something like:

     * `client/src/pages/calendar/*.tsx`
     * or `client/src/components/calendar/*`
   * Identify where the **platform icon** is chosen/rendered for each post/event.

2. **Inspect the data for each event**

   * Determine what field indicates the platform for each scheduled/published post (e.g. `platform`, `job.platform`, `connection.platform`, etc.).
   * Confirm what values are used for:

     * Instagram (e.g. `"instagram"`)
     * X / Twitter (e.g. `"x"` or `"twitter"`)
     * TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc., if they are already supported.

3. **Fix the icon mapping**

   * Replace any hard-coded Instagram icon with a **platform-based mapping**.

   * Implement a clean mapping function or object, for example:

     ```ts
     const PLATFORM_ICON_MAP: Record<string, JSX.Element> = {
       instagram: <InstagramIcon />,
       twitter: <XIcon />,   // or twitter
       x: <XIcon />,
       tiktok: <TiktokIcon />,
       linkedin: <LinkedinIcon />,
       pinterest: <PinterestIcon />,
       youtube: <YoutubeIcon />,
     };
     ```

   * Use the event’s platform value (normalized to lower case) to select the correct icon.

   * Provide a simple, neutral fallback icon if the platform is unknown.

4. **Do NOT change anything else**

   * Do **not** modify scheduling logic, worker code, Redis, or backend endpoints.
   * Do **not** change how events are loaded or saved.
   * Only update the **UI logic** responsible for selecting and rendering the platform icon in the calendar tiles.

5. **Show me the diff**

   * After you implement the fix, show:

     * The file(s) you changed
     * The **before/after diff** of the icon-selection code
   * Briefly explain:

     * What field you used for the platform
     * How you’re mapping it to icons now.

The goal:

* X posts show the **X/Twitter icon**
* Instagram posts show the **Instagram icon**
* Other platforms (TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, etc.) show their correct icons wherever supported.
