I want to add a new feature to my PicscripterAI app called "Batch Mode."

Requirements:

1. Add a new page: client/src/pages/batch-mode.tsx
2. UI Features:
   - Category selector with these exact options:
     ["real_estate", "food", "travel", "ecommerce", "fashion", "custom"]
   - Tone selector (reuse existing tones system).
   - A table where each row represents one product/post with these fields:
        title (text)
        details (textarea)
        price (text, optional)
        location (text, optional)
        mediaUrls (comma-separated image URLs)
        platforms (checkboxes: instagram, facebook, pinterest, twitter)
        action (dropdown: description_only, post_now, schedule)
        scheduledAt (datetime input, only visible when action = schedule)
   - Button to add/remove product rows
   - Button: "Generate Batch"
   - Display generated descriptions inside the table once finished.

3. Create a backend endpoint:
   POST /api/batch
   Input:
      category: string
      tone: string
      items: array of:
        id, title, details, price, location, mediaUrls[], platforms[], action, scheduledAt
   Output:
      results: array of { id, description, status, errorMessage? }

4. Generation logic:
   Use the same Gemini model already used for caption generation ("gemini-2.5-flash")
   Use category-based prompting with these rules:

   real_estate:
      - Tone: use selected tone
      - Audience: renters or buyers
      - Emphasize property features, location benefits, lifestyle
      - Must include a short CTA (DM for tour, schedule viewing, etc.)

   food:
      - Tone: use selected tone, appetizing language
      - Emphasize flavor, texture, ingredients, unique taste
      - Works as caption for social posting

   travel:
      - Tone: inspiring and descriptive
      - Emphasize scenery, experience, atmosphere, reasons to visit
      - CTA allowed but optional

   ecommerce:
      - Tone: sales-friendly, benefit-driven
      - 2-3 paragraphs + 3-5 bullet benefits
      - Include 1 short CTA

   fashion:
      - Tone: style-forward, confident
      - Fit, look, occasion, how to style it
      - CTA optional

   custom:
      - Tone: generic marketing tone
      - Use details as provided, do not invent false info

5. Action behavior:
   - If action = "description_only": return description in response only
   - If action = "post_now": call the same posting service used for immediate posting
   - If action = "schedule": insert scheduled post using the existing scheduling / Redis worker

6. Limits:
   - Max rows per batch: 20
   - If more than 20, return an error.

7. Add navigation link:
   - Label: "Batch Mode"
   - Add to sidebar / menu

8. The final output should store user-generated descriptions so they appear in Drafts.

Do NOT break existing single-post generation. Add this feature alongside current functionality.
