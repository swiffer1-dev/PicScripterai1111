Please choose **Option 2**: enable the feature flag and verify all backend scheduling endpoints before making large frontend changes.

**Do now (no UI changes yet):**

1. **Enable flag**

   * Add `FEATURE_SCHEDULE_PENDING=true` to `.env` (and `.env.example` commented).
   * Restart server.

2. **Quick sanity tests (automate or run via REST client)**

   * Create a simple script or use `curl` commands to call:

     * **POST /api/schedule** with no connected platforms → should return `status:"scheduled_pending"` and `preflight_issues` (e.g., missing Pinterest board).
     * **GET /api/calendar?month=YYYY-MM** → should include the new item with `scheduledAt`, `status`, and platforms.
     * **PATCH /api/schedule/:id/resolve** with required fields (e.g., `boardId`) → should return `status:"scheduled"` and set `job_id` (BullMQ enqueued).
   * Log results clearly (console output) so I can read pass/fail quickly.

**Acceptance for this step:**

* Flag is active.
* A pending schedule can be created without connected platforms.
* Calendar endpoint returns it.
* Resolve endpoint enqueues it (job_id present) and status becomes `scheduled`.
* No regressions to existing publish/queue code.

**After backend passes, proceed with frontend in safe slices (separate PRs/commits):**

* **Slice A:** Make calendar cells clickable → open “Schedule Post” drawer (date prefilled). Wire it to **POST /api/schedule**; show toast with returned status (“Pending”/“Scheduled”).
* **Slice B:** Render status dots from **GET /api/calendar** (grey=pending, blue=scheduled).
* **Slice C:** Click an item → “Resolve” modal (platform selectors) → **PATCH /api/schedule/:id/resolve**.
* **Slice D (polish):** platform chips, missing-board tooltip, empty states.

Constraints:

* Additive only; do not change existing publish logic or OAuth flows.
* If any test fails, stop and report the failing request/response with minimal diff.

Commit messages:

* `feat(schedule): enable pending mode via FEATURE_SCHEDULE_PENDING`
* `test(schedule): backend sanity checks for create/pending/resolve`
